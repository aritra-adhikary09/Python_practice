### **Practice Question — Payment System (Abstraction)**

**Concept:** Abstraction using Abstract Base Classes

**Problem Statement:**

Create an abstract class named `Payment` that contains an abstract method called `process_payment()`.

Then create the following subclasses:

1. `CreditCardPayment`
2. `UPIPayment`
3. `CashPayment`

Each subclass must implement the `process_payment()` method in a different way, based on how that payment method works.

---

### **Tasks to Complete:**

1. Use the `abc` module to create the abstract base class `Payment`
2. Declare `process_payment()` as an abstract method inside `Payment`
3. Implement the `process_payment()` method in:

   * `CreditCardPayment`
   * `UPIPayment`
   * `CashPayment`
4. Create one object of each subclass
5. Call the `process_payment()` method for each object

---

### **Rules:**

* You must **not** create an object of the `Payment` class
* All subclasses **must** implement the `process_payment()` method
* Each subclass should show different behavior when `process_payment()` is called

### **Expected Learning Outcome:**

* Understand how abstraction works in Python
* Learn how to enforce method implementation using abstract classes
* Practice real-world design using abstract base classes
