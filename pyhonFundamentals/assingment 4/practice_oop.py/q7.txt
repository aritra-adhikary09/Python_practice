### **Problem 2: Employee Salary Calculation (Function Overriding)**

**Concept:** Function Overriding

---

#### **Scenario**

A company employs different types of workers.
Each type of employee calculates their salary in a different way.
You need to design a system using **function overriding** to handle this.

---

#### **Task**

1. Create a base class named **`Employee`**.

2. Inside the `Employee` class, define a method called **`calculate_salary()`**.

   * This method should return `0`.
   * It acts as a default placeholder.

3. Create the following subclasses that **override** the `calculate_salary()` method:

   * **`FullTimeEmployee`**
   * **`PartTimeEmployee`**
   * **`Intern`**

---

#### **Salary Calculation Rules**

* **FullTimeEmployee**

  * Salary is a fixed monthly amount.

* **PartTimeEmployee**

  * Salary = hourly_rate × hours_worked

* **Intern**

  * Salary is a fixed stipend.

---

#### **Requirements**

* The method name **`calculate_salary()`** must be the same in all classes.
* Each subclass must provide its **own implementation** of `calculate_salary()`.
* Use constructors (`__init__`) to initialize required values.
* Demonstrate **polymorphism** by:

  * Storing different employee objects in a list
  * Calling `calculate_salary()` in a loop 

---

#### **Rules**

* Do NOT write salary logic in the base class.
* Do NOT change the method name in subclasses.
* Focus on overriding, not conditional logic (`if/else`).

---

#### **Expected Learning Outcome**

* Understand function overriding
* Understand runtime polymorphism
* Learn how the same method behaves differently for different objects
