### **Problem 2 — Method Reuse + Extension (Inheritance)**

**Concept:** Inheritance and Method Overriding

**Problem Statement:**

Create a base class named `Vehicle` with the following:

1. Attributes:

   * `brand`
   * `model`

2. A method named `get_type()` that returns the string:

   ```
   "Generic Vehicle"
   ```

Then create two subclasses:

### **Car (Subclass of Vehicle)**

1. Inherit from the `Vehicle` class
2. Override the `get_type()` method so that it returns:

   ```
   "Car"
   ```

### **Bike (Subclass of Vehicle)**

1. Inherit from the `Vehicle` class
2. Override the `get_type()` method so that it returns:

   ```
   "Bike"
   ```

### **Tasks to Complete:**

1. Create one object of `Car`
2. Create one object of `Bike`
3. Call the `get_type()` method for both objects
4. Print the returned values

**Expected Learning Outcome:**

* Understand how child classes reuse methods from a parent class
* Learn how to override a parent class method in subclasses
* Observe different outputs from the same method name using inheritance
