### **Problem 3 — Additional Child-Specific Methods (Inheritance)**

**Concept:** Inheritance and Child-Specific Methods

**Problem Statement:**

Create a base class named `Vehicle` with the following:

1. Attributes:

   * `brand`
   * `model`

2. A constructor (`__init__`) to initialize these attributes.

Then create two subclasses:

---

### **Car (Subclass of Vehicle)**

1. Inherit from the `Vehicle` class
2. Add an additional attribute:

   * `seats`
3. Create a method named `seating_capacity()` that:

   * returns the number of seats in the car

---

### **Bike (Subclass of Vehicle)**

1. Inherit from the `Vehicle` class
2. Add an additional attribute:

   * `engine_cc`
3. Create a method named `engine_details()` that:

   * returns the engine capacity of the bike in cc

---

### **Tasks to Complete:**

1. Create one object of `Car`
2. Create one object of `Bike`
3. Call:

   * `seating_capacity()` using the `Car` object
   * `engine_details()` using the `Bike` object
4. Print the returned values

---

### **Expected Learning Outcome:**

* Understand how subclasses can add their own attributes
* Learn that child classes can have methods not present in the parent class
* Practice clean inheritance without code duplication
